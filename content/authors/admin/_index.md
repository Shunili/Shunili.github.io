I'm a 5th year PhD student in the [Statistics department at UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Haiyan Huang](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~hhuang/). My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics machine learning and biological/medical research. I'm currently developing gene-gene interaction networks along a pseudotime trajectory utilizing single-cell RNA sequence data. Some of my past research projects are primarily centered around employing deep learning advancements to guide the design of biological sequences and chemical materials.
